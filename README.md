**Welcome to** [**Trality**](https://www.trality.com)**!**

From choosing the right tools to finding a profitable trading strategy, the journey to becoming a successful trader is far from easy.

But we‚Äôre changing that.

At Trality, we are bridging the gap between professional and private trading by making it possible for everyone to access the technology that powers automated trading bots, helping you to make smarter, unbiased and fully automatic trades.

<h2>Creating the best crypto trading bots with Trality</h2>

Let's take a closer look at Trality‚Äôs revolutionary bot creation tools and find out how easy it is to code, backtest and deploy your own algorithmic trading bots for live-trading on your favourite crypto exchanges.

When building a bot with Trality, you have two options:

- **The Rule Builder** üèó

Trality‚Äôs Rule Builder is a simple yet incredibly powerful tool that lets you build algorithmic trading bots by simply dragging and dropping technical indicators based on boolean logic so it's the same as building your own trading algorithm without actually writing a single line of code.

- **The Code Editor** üêç

Trality‚Äôs Code Editor is the world‚Äôs first browser-based Python Code Editor and comes with a state-of-the-art Python API, an ever growing array of packages, a debugger and a full range of technical analysis indicators.

It offers the highest levels of flexibility and sophistication available in private trading.

And since it‚Äôs front-end based, all of the algorithm creation and backtesting happens entirely in your browser. Even we can‚Äôt see your trading ideas, which ensures maximum levels of privacy and security.

- **Backtesting and Live-trading** üöÄ

Once finished creating and setting up your bot, you can check its performance on historical data using our lightning-quick backtester. Backtesting is the backbone of strategy development and should be an essential tool in every trader's toolbox. That‚Äôs why our talented team of developers have ensured that our backtester performs as fast and as reliably as possible.

It only takes a few seconds to run a backtest, saving you precious time that you can use to fine-tune your trading strategy or test new ideas.

Once you‚Äôre satisfied with the results, deploy your bot for live-trading or paper-trading on your preferred exchange. Simply connect your exchange account with the API keys and you‚Äôre all set. Your bot will immediately start scanning live data, generate signals and execute trades based on your pre-defined rules.

**How do crypto trading bots actually work?**

In order to trade on an exchange, a trading bot needs access to your exchange account, which you grant by using API keys (Application Program Interface). When the bot is connected with your exchange with an API key, it can trade on your behalf based on your instructions. When authorization has been revoked, the bot can no longer access your account and trading ceases. You are in full control.

Signal generator > risk allocation > execution

The actual process behind trading bots occurs in three main stages. The first stage basically automates the type of work that the trader does by introducing data into a signal generator in order to look for trading opportunities or analyze price trends and patterns. The second stage involves risk allocation in which the bot spreads out the risk based on the trader‚Äôs preferences. And the final stage is the execution during which the signals are converted into requests for API keys that the exchange uses to buy and/or sell.

**The many advantages of crypto trading bots**

When it comes to cryptocurrency trading, there are no opening or closing bells. Crypto markets never sleep, which means that any downtime that we take to eat, sleep, walk the dog or head to the shops translates into missed opportunities.

There‚Äôs also the elephant in the room. Wall Street. You‚Äôve probably already read that 80% of stock market trading is performed by algorithmic programs. Private traders are often put off by their perceptions of algorithmic trading. It‚Äôs too complicated. It‚Äôs expensive. We‚Äôre here to tell you that it‚Äôs neither and we‚Äôve designed a cutting-edge platform with advanced tools and an array of educational resources as proof.

So what are some of the advantages of using trading bots? We can think of a handful:

‚úîÔ∏è Emotionless trading
‚úîÔ∏è Higher trading speeds
‚úîÔ∏è Risk diversification
‚úîÔ∏è Consistent trading discipline

**Best practices for creating successful trading bots**

Practice makes perfect and it‚Äôs no different with algorithmic trading. Before going live with your bot, you‚Äôll want to become completely comfortable with the ins and outs of algorithmic trading, which is why you should backtest and paper trade in order to simulate trades before engaging in actual ones. And be sure to read through [Trality Docs](https://docs.trality.com), an important part of our website that contains a wealth of informative material written in plain English.

But there is also the matter of best practices. It‚Äôs one thing to create a trading bot, but quite another to create a successful trading bot in a manner that is both prudent and efficient. While we don‚Äôt have the magic key that will unlock the door to wealth via automated trading, we do know a thing or two about the value of working within a general framework designed to meet and exceed certain benchmarks safely and strategically.

Consider some of the following points as best practices when thinking about, developing and implementing a trading bot (or bots).

Backtest, backtest, and backtest some more

Would you buy a car without taking it for a test drive or scanning its computer to look for trouble codes? Think of ‚Äúbacktesting‚Äù as basically like taking your crypto trading bot for a ‚Äútest drive.‚Äù In fact, you should take it for multiple test drives under different conditions to ensure that it performs safely and predictably before driving it through the crowded cryptocurrency marketplace. Only when you‚Äôve backtested it repeatedly using historical data will you have a more accurate picture of how well (or not so well) your trading strategy is expected to perform in the future.

Past Performance Is No Guarantee of Future Results 

Perfect, you‚Äôve done your due diligence by treating your trading bot to a battery of backtesting and it has performed well consistently. You‚Äôre not out of the woods yet. Once you take it live, you should continue to pay close attention to how it performs. It‚Äôs a rare thing that works perfectly straight out of the box. If we continue with our car analogy, upgraded engines or suspension systems always need a fair bit of additional fine tuning in order to achieve optimal results safely and reliably. The same principle applies to trading bots.

Diversify

Variety may be the spice of life, but a diversified portfolio will reduce a trader‚Äôs exposure to any one particular asset. But beyond risk mitigation, diversity is important for things such as producing a smoother equity curve. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve decided to trade a dozen different cryptocurrencies, but they‚Äôre producing the same signals. In this case, diversity is a moot point, since you‚Äôd be better off just trading one coin. The goal is to aim for sufficient diversification of signals in order to justify multiple coins and thereby position your portfolio for future returns.

**Be part of the fintech revolution**

High-frequency trading has harnessed the tremendous advances in computing power in order to deploy algorithms in a range of financial applications, which have proven to be more efficient than their human counterparts.

At Trality, we are committed to the ideal that every single trader should benefit from the advantages of algorithmic trading bots. Take your trading to the next level with our tried-and-tested advanced tools and benefit from our educational, community-driven platform, which sees learning and development as a trader before all else.
